# bunningsstock3
This was a basic node app that scraped the Bunnings (Australian hardware store) website for stock level metadata to display stock levels of in-demand goods (good during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Australia for finding methylated spirits).
It did this by misusing their API that was used to search for other stores with stock of an item.

Bunnings has unfortunately removed stock metadata from their API, so this code no longer works.
